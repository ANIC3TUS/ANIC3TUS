Howdy hey, Iâ€™m @ANIC3TUS, I'm muddling through certifications and learning how to code a little along the way. At work I get to play around with fancy networking and personal computing equipment all the live long day; however, when I get home I get to cope with the fact that I'm not as well endowed as my corporate overlords. That being said, my homelab currently consists of a:

  Dell Poweredge 1950, which I use for: 

    -game servers

    -web servers

    -home automation

  Heavily modified Dell Optiplex, which I have tricked out to serve as a temporary NAS which I use for:

    -Steam Library Cache

    -PlexMedia Server

    -eBook & Audio Book library

    -iCloud Phone Backup

  Pi Cluster, which I use for:

    -Video rendering

  MeLe Quieter 3, which I use for:

    -My linux machine

      -Grew up on Ubuntu/Debian

      -Found my true love Fedora

    -My development station

    -To manage my other homelab devices
  
Currently, I am working on further building out my homelab (such as building out a proper NAS and increasing the size of my PiCluster to 10). If I am not working on my homelab or some other project then I am likely contributing to my local mutual aid organization or working on a project for the Housing Co-op that I am a founding member of.

I am currently in the process of getting my Network+ cert which I'll follow up with my Security+. After those are out of the way I intend to take some time and either pursue more or just go ahead and get a bacheolor's in either IT Systems or Computer Science. Maybe a few certifications before and after, I think I'm just addicted to certifications. 

Though I doubt anything I make will be super popular or useful, any and all code posted to this account is free and open source cause I mean, that's the point, right?
