Howdy hey, Iâ€™m @ANIC3TUS, an IT specialist focused on network administration, cloud operations, and asset management. At work I get to play around with fancy networking and personal computing equipment all the live long day; however, when I get home I get to cope with the fact that I'm not as well endowed as my corporate overlords. That being said, my homelab currently consists of a:

-Dell Poweredge 1950, which I use for: 
  -game servers
  -web servers
  -home automation
-Heavily modified Dell Optiplex, which I have tricked out to serve as a temporary NAS which I use for:
  -Steam Library Cache
  -PlexMedia Server
  -eBook & Audio Book library
  -iCloud Phone Backup
-Pi Cluster, which I use for:
  -Video rendering
-MeLe Quieter 3, which I use for:
  -My linux machine
    -Grew up on Ubuntu/Debian
    -Found my true love Fedora
  -My development station
  -To manage my other homelab devices
  
Currently, I am working on further building out my homelab (such as building out a proper NAS and increasing the size of my PiCluster to 10). If I am not working on my homelab or some other project then I am likely contributing to my local mutual aid organization or working on a project for the Housing Co-op that I am a founding member of.

I am in the process of preparing for my CybSec+, PenTest+, and CCNA (not in that order) while also learning more about programming. While I'm familiar with JS, I am currently taking courses and reading texts on C/C++/C# and Python. For my journey into C, I am learning through the medium of game creation. My current C game project is a Doom clone built from scratch that I am calling "Erin go Bragh", where instead of slaying demons you fight for one united Eire. 

Though I doubt anything I make will be super popular or useful, any and all code posted to this account is free and open source cause I mean, that's the point, right?
